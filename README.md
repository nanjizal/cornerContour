A 2D vector drawing library for **Haxe**, can be used directly from [trilateral3](https://github.com/nanjizal/trilateral3) ( it is the core of trilateral ).
  
It breaks down lines and curves into triangles for use with your prefered toolkit.

CornerContour does not provide texture, fills or gradient and focuses on contours. For additional features look at trilateral3 for implemention ideas.
  
( Still considering if shapes like rounded corners should be moved over from trilateral. )
